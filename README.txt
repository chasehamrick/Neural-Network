Txt files called Data include all the data, txt files called answer only have final answer

for question 8, I chose to test data about white wine, which included iinput about ts fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content.. and an output variable of quality between 0 and 10.

when I increased from 40 to 80 hidden layers I got a much better response, jumping up from an average accuracy of about 0.05 to 0.3, and a max accuracy of around 0.3 to about 0.5.

I am not sure if it is because of how many different types of white wine there was in the data but, I was running a training set of 3338 and a test set of 1560 which was pretty big compared to the red wine data set.

Overall I am pretty happy with the outcome.
